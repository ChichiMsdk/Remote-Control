# What is this ?
The goal is to be able to use one mouse or keyboard through multiple computers while each computer can keep their own mouse and keyboard and change on the fly.<br>
# Which platform will be supported ?
This should work on macOs, linux or windows seemlessly.<br>
Might add GUI interface without using any preexisting library, (for the sake of learning), so I'll have to make my own GUI library for each platform first.<br>
